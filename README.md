## Problem Statement

<br>

In the modern software development world, APIs are proving to be the most widely used software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. This makes it an essential component in every development project. One professional project implements more than hundreds or thousands of APIs that only continues to scale-up in future releases.

Testing these APIs becomes an essential part of the development process because one single error in design or implementation could lead to a greater issue which may affect security, robustness or may crash the application/tool on an edge case.

Coffee-break can test all your REST APIs with auto generated  test cases and edge test cases to fully test all your APIs. This allows you to test and check your APIs in order to make a robust application. Along with this it certifies your

## Solution

### Existing Solution

<br>

* HTTP request handlers: Tools like REST Client vscode extension (CLI) or Postman (GUI) can be used to send HTTP requests to APIs in hosted servers and the response generated is again presented by these tools. :rage:
* Testing Packages: Packages like npm/mocha with assertion libraries like npm/chai are used a lot for any general testing, not just APIs. All the test cases have to be hard coded and individually asserted in order to get tested.
* Katalon Studio: It is a complete development office suite used for noting down requirements, creating uml, user stories, etc, diagrams, design, implementation and testing. But even here manually test cases has to be written in order to test modules.
